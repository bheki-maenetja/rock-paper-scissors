## Overview

## Development
The game was built using the React 3 Javascript framework. It has only one component built from rudimentary, HTML/JSX and styled with SASS/SCSS. The gamplay is implemented with two functions: handleClick and getWinner. The handleClick function allows the user to make their choice whilst also enabling the computer to make its random choice. When both choices have been made the getWinner function is called; this function decides the winner based on the aforementioned rules of the game.
```
// The getWinner function

getWinner = (playerChoice, compChoice) => {
    const { player, computer } = this.state
    let winnerText, playerScore, compScore

    if (playerChoice === compChoice){
      winnerText = 'It\'s a tie ü§ù'
      playerScore = player.score
      compScore = computer.score
      return [winnerText, playerScore, compScore]
    }
    
    const choiceTable = {
      'rock': ['lizard', 'scissors'],
      'paper': ['rock', 'spock'],
      'scissors': ['paper', 'lizard'],
      'lizard': ['paper', 'spock'],
      'spock': ['rock', 'scissors']
    }

    if (choiceTable[playerChoice].includes(compChoice)) {
      playerScore = player.score + 1
      compScore = computer.score
      winnerText = `${player.name} üòÅ`
    } else {
      compScore = computer.score + 1
      playerScore = player.score
      winnerText = `${computer.name} üñ•`
    }

    return [winnerText, playerScore, compScore]
  }
```
